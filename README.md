## Tips for Using Your Free Spins Efficiently

Now that you have your 5000 free spins, it‚Äôs important to use them wisely. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your spins:

### 1. **Prioritize Raids and Attacks**

While it‚Äôs tempting to spin whenever you get a free chance, it‚Äôs essential to avoid wasting spins. If you have enough coins to build or upgrade your village, make sure to do so before spinning again. Also, keep an eye out for the ‚Äúshield‚Äù symbol during your spins‚Äîthis will protect your village from attacks and can save you a lot of coins in the long run.

### 4. **Take Advantage of Free Spin Events**
